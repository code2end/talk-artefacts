# Exchange Core - Technical Overview

# Business Overview

## What It Is

The Exchange Core module is the fundamental data access and business logic library for cryptocurrency exchange trading operations within the CoinExchange platform. This component encapsulates all core domain entities, data access objects (DAOs), and business services required for managing cryptocurrency trading pairs, processing buy/sell orders, tracking trade executions, and maintaining market data.

As a core library component, it provides essential foundation services to other modules in the system including the exchange API, market services, and trading engines.

## Domain Concepts

The Exchange Core models several key domain concepts fundamental to cryptocurrency exchange operations:

- **Trading Pairs (ExchangeCoin)**: Configuration and metadata for cryptocurrency trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT), including trading rules, fees, limits, and market status
- **Exchange Orders**: Buy and sell orders placed by users, supporting both limit price and market price order types with comprehensive lifecycle management
- **Trade Execution**: Completed trades resulting from order matching, including detailed transaction records and settlement information
- **Market Data**: Real-time and historical market information including price tickers, candlestick charts (K-line data), and order book depth
- **User Preferences**: Personal trading preferences such as favorite trading symbols for enhanced user experience

## Component Boundaries

The Exchange Core serves as a foundational data access layer and does not expose external APIs directly. Instead, it provides internal Java interfaces consumed by other components within the exchange system.

> **Pointers for Functional Testing:**
> 
> - **Order Processing Testing**: Validate order creation, status transitions (TRADING â†’ COMPLETED/CANCELED), and wallet balance updates
> - **Trade Execution Testing**: Verify trade matching logic, fee calculations, and settlement accuracy
> - **Market Data Testing**: Ensure K-line generation, order book updates, and price ticker calculations
> - **Data Consistency Testing**: Validate referential integrity between orders, trades, and wallet transactions

### Contract Interfaces Provided

#### Internal Java APIs

- **Business Functions:** The module exposes Spring-managed service beans for order management, trade processing, market data access, and configuration management
    
- **Endpoint Behavior:** Services are transactional and state-changing, handling complex business logic for order lifecycle management and trade settlement

## Algorithms / Business Processes

### Order Matching and Execution Logic

The module implements sophisticated order processing algorithms:

#### Order Placement Validation
- **Balance Verification**: For buy orders, validates sufficient base currency; for sell orders, validates sufficient trading currency
- **Trading Limits**: Enforces minimum/maximum order amounts and daily trading limits per trading pair
- **Market Hours**: Respects trading pair availability and market status

#### Trade Settlement Processing
- **Dual-Currency Settlement**: Handles simultaneous settlement of both trading currencies in a matched trade
- **Fee Calculation**: Applies configurable trading fees with special handling for market makers and system accounts
- **Wallet Operations**: Atomic balance updates including unfreezing placed orders and crediting received currencies

```

#### Referral Reward Distribution
- **Commission Calculation**: Multi-level referral rewards based on trading fees with configurable rates
- **Eligibility Verification**: Time-based eligibility checks and user relationship validation
- **Automated Distribution**: Real-time distribution of referral commissions to qualifying accounts

### Market Data Aggregation

#### Order Book Management (TradePlate)
- **Price Level Aggregation**: Maintains ordered lists of buy/sell orders by price level
- **Depth Calculation**: Real-time computation of market depth and liquidity metrics
- **Order Book Updates**: Efficient insertion, removal, and modification of order book entries

#### K-Line Generation
- **OHLCV Data**: Calculation of Open, High, Low, Close, Volume data for various time periods
- **Volume Aggregation**: Accurate tracking of trading volumes and turnover amounts
- **Time Period Management**: Support for multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d, etc.)

# Technical Overview

## Implementation Summary

Exchange Core is a Spring Boot library module built with Java, utilizing JPA for relational data persistence and MongoDB for time-series market data storage. The module employs QueryDSL for type-safe database queries and Lombok for reducing boilerplate code. It follows a layered architecture with separate entity, repository, service, and utility layers.

## Implementation Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: Core application framework providing dependency injection, transaction management, and configuration management
- **Spring Data JPA**: Object-relational mapping and repository pattern implementation for MySQL database operations
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: Document-based data access for time-series market data storage and retrieval
- **QueryDSL**: Type-safe query construction library enabling complex database queries with compile-time validation
- **Lombok**: Code generation library reducing boilerplate for entity classes, getters, setters, and constructors
- **FastJSON**: High-performance JSON serialization library for API responses and message processing
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation with QueryDSL code generation integration

**Architectural Patterns:**
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer pattern for business logic encapsulation
- Domain-driven design with rich entity models

## Local Runtime Environment
