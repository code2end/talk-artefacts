# Step 13: Final Integration and Testing Setup

## Objective
Complete the XRP wallet implementation by ensuring all components are properly wired together and providing verification steps.

## Requirements

Please provide:

1. **Integration Verification Checklist**:
   - Verify all beans are properly configured and injected
   - Ensure MongoDB collections are created with proper indexes
   - Confirm Eureka service registration works correctly
   - Validate API endpoints return expected responses

2. **Build and Deployment Instructions**:
   - Maven build commands for the XRP module
   - JAR execution with proper classpath
   - Service startup verification steps

3. **API Testing Examples**:
   - Sample curl commands for each endpoint
   - Expected response formats
   - Test scenarios for address generation, balance queries, and withdrawals

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**:
   - Common startup issues and solutions
   - Logging configuration for debugging
   - Service health check endpoints

5. **Integration Points Summary**:
